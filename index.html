      <h4>Moving to Washington:</h4>
      <li>Originally from Southern California, I didn't enjoy the constant heat that Palm Desert provided. After graduating from High School I originally intended to enlist in the US Navy. However my mother was around for Vietnam and did not want me anywhere near the horrors she saw. Thus, I moved up north here to Seattle to begin a new life away from SoCal.</li>
      <h4>Work history:</h4>
      <li>My work life is mainly centered at Seatac Airport, I originally worked in the customs area, working my way to the position of Operations Agent for a company called Swissport where I supervised and coordinated many air operations for the company. I was considered such a valuable asset that when the company came out with a proprietary new system, i was tasked as head administrator and trainer for my branch. Management and coworker alike, I trained them and authorized them on this system. After some personal life events I found myself experimenting with various fields of work to find a job I felt satisfied at. I began to see that I wanted more out of life and that I needed a job that challenged me to be better and sharper.</li>
      <h4>Goals:</h4>
      <li>One day, I will graduate as an official Software Developer. Instead of spending all the new money I will make, I wanna save up to buy a some land and build my dream home. Afterwords I plan to invest in Real Estate, Stocks, and businesses while working my way up in the ranks of the Tech Industry. I plan to go as far as my ambition will take me and beyond. So one day I can live the life I earned, get married, and be the best man I can be for myself. and my loved ones.</li>
